The [metadata-extractor project](https://drewnoakes.com/code/exif/) maintains a database of sample images from many different models of camera, scanner, smart phone and software product.

This collection has been largely built by the contributions of many kind people from all over the world and internet.

You can [view the full collection on GitHub](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-images) and use it in any way you see fit.

# Uses

Having a large variety of input files aids in the development of this project.

* As a system that consumes long streams of binary data, there are many possibilities for unexpected input. Variety is good.
* Performance tests can more easily be run across large numbers of differing images.
* It offers a convenient form of regression testing, as output metadata is captured within the repository.

# Contribute

Despite being a large collection already, camera manufacturers have been busy producing hundreds of new camera models each year. It's highly likely that you have a camera which is not present in the list.

This is a public resource! If you are kind enough to contribute to it, you must also be careful enough to ensure that you have permission to grant use of the image to the project. Be aware that your camera may also support GPS, in which case your location might be included in the image.

The content of the image is not important. You may take a photo of a white wall if you wish, though interesting photos are more, well, interesting.

Please ensure that the image comes directly from the camera and is not modified by any software.

To send the file:

  * Ideally, submit a pull request against [metadata-extractor-images](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-images), but you can also try opening an issue and attaching it
  * If the file is too large for GitHub issues, use a service such as [wetransfer](https://www.wetransfer.com/)

You will be credited for your contribution in the commit log. Please mention if you prefer to remain anonymous.

Please be sure to explicitly state that you grant permission to this project to use the image as described on this wiki page.
